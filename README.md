# Sentiment Analysis

The purpose of this exercise is to understand how to process reviews in Marketing data. I have used the google play store reviews dataset found on Kaggle, and performed a short sentiment analysis.

The deliverable was to build a model to process the text, and to predict whether a new review would be positive, neutral or negative.

To do this, there are 3 types of models run here. The first was a Logistic Regression, with basic pre-processing done in order to run. In the follow-up, I used the NLTK library to remove the stopwords and lemmatize the reviews. I ran the Logistic Regression again, with an improved accuracy on the classification rate. The third model ran was an SVM with a linear kernel. This was run on the data that was already modified by the NLTK library.

More to follow.
